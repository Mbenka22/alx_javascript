JavaScript form validation refers to the process of verifying the data entered into an HTML form on a web page using JavaScript code. This validation process ensures that the data submitted by users meets certain criteria or constraints before it is sent to the server for further processing.

The purpose of form validation is to enhance the user experience by providing immediate feedback on incorrect or incomplete input, thereby reducing the likelihood of errors and improving data quality. It also helps in preventing malicious or unintended submissions that could potentially harm the application or compromise its security.
